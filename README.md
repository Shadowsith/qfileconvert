# qt-fileconverter
A Qt/C++ based frontend to convert files easily without console knowledge.

__!This is project is on a early development status!__

## Motivation:
On the internet it gives several websites where you can convert your filetype to another easily.<br>
But are these sites trustful with your data? Or do they save them for their own purposes (sell informations etc.)

This and the not exists of comparable software for the desktop are my motiviation to create this Qt program.<br>
It is open source, costs nothing and give a normal user the control of his data back.
